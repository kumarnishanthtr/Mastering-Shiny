# Mastering-Shiny
Github journey for the Mastering Shiny book by Hadley Wickham

Shiny is a framework for creating web applications using R code.
Shiny allows you to take your work in R and expose it via a web browser so that anyone can use it.
its user interface components can be easily customized or extended, and its server uses reactive programming to let you create any type of back end logic you want.

Uses of Shiny:
 * Create dashboards that track important high-level performance indicators
 * Replace hundreds of pages of PDFs with interactive apps
 * Communicate complex models to a non-technical audience with informative visualisations
 * Provide self-service data analysis for common workflows, replacing email requests with a Shiny app that allows people to upload their own data and perform standard analyses. 

 Introduction:
 two key components of every Shiny app: the UI and the server function
 UI - How the app looks
 Server - How the app works
 Shiny uses reactive programming
